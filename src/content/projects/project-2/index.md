energyGhost is a web-based platform to accompany and support building owners and energy consultants during an energy consultation and energy refurbishment.

The currently prevailing problem is the inadequate supply of information to building owners in preparation for an energy consultation and a massive overload of energy consultants due to very high demand. Data collection by an energy consultant during a home inspection is currently still cumbersome and time-consuming, which means that waiting times for a consultation are currently up to 6 months.

> The demand for energy advice has increased almost tenfold in the last two years. Further increases are to be expected. The approach presented in the bachelor's thesis is ideally suited to using modern media to increase both the quality and quantity of energy consultations.
- Klaus Lambrecht, Partner at ECONSULT Lambrecht Jungmann Partnerschaft, Head of the German Energy Consultant Day

energyGhost serves to take the building owner by the hand and guide him through the process of an energy consultation, right up to an energy-efficient renovation.
A good preparation and information supply is one of the most important prerequisites for a smooth and quick energy consultation. In a comprehensive information portal, the user can explore information and articles on interesting topics, while in the renovation configurator integrated in energyGhost he can playfully discover initial impressions of the effects of a renovation on heating costs and energy consumption.

Through structured data management, energyGhost offers its users a common place to collect important documents, files and information, which can then be accessed by everyone involved in a project.

Project related document collection

One of the special features is the search for an energy consultant. Just like on established dating platforms, a match is created here by comparing two profiles, which means that the client can find an energy consultant who is perfectly suited to their project.

On the other hand, the energy consultant also benefits from supporting the client. Well-structured support for the client prevents time losses that can arise due to missing documents, a poor communication channel or a lack of understanding of the project.

The highlight for the energy consultant is an additional reduction in workload thanks to an innovative solution. With energyGhost, he no longer documents his home inspection using analog means, but records it fully automatically with smart glasses that save both text and images. This interactive video can then be explored retrospectively by both the building owner and the energy consultant. The recorded spoken word is converted into text form by artificial intelligence and then leads to the corresponding video location by clicking on any sentence.

energyGhost combines various problem-solving functions with the aim of boosting the renovation market, supporting building owners and relieving the burden on energy consultants. The result should be an increased renovation rate and the prospect of a more energy-efficient future.

We are already working very closely with our experts and contacts, such as the consumer advice center, energy agencies and others, and are in the process of exchanging ideas for the realization of the project so that every building owner and energy consultant will have energyGhost at their disposal in the future.

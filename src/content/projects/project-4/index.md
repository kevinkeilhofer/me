This project revolved around the development of a concept and design for an in-flight entertainment system for a fictitious airline.

First of all, we structured what content the in-flight entertainment system should contain. To do this, we researched other airlines to find out what content is shown in the application and summarized important findings for us. In the low fidelity phase, we carried out visual research and outlined the components and user guidance. Before moving on to the mid-fidelity phase, we created a suitable grid and defined the font and hierarchy. We then created the color palette and defined the button states.

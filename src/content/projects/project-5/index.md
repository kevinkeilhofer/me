The task was to develop a plant app. The application was adapted to the persona of “Sara, 33 years old, project manager” in terms of function and design.
Sara has the option of adding plants from a database and connecting them to a sensor. The sensor measures the humidity and displays the data in the overview.
Sara also has the option of adding new plants in the overview, adjusting the watering times or watering the plants directly.
